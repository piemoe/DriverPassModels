# DriverPassModels
This repo is a collection of models made for a project "DriverPass" designed to help develop the project when the time comes.

## Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
DriverPass is a concept to help students study and prepare for their driving test. It offers packages for students to purchase that offer study material and appointments with driver teachers. The systems required to make it work are the usual account management and sign-in systems, a system to make appointments with drivers, and a system to update policies from the DMV to the website.

## What did you do particularly well?
I believe that my models are fairly detailed. In planning, it is important to get a complete picture of the project. That is why in models like my Use Case Diagram, there are cases that seem like obvious inclusions (like resetting one's password) but should be included at the start of project planning so that they can be included in time budgeting.

## If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
One thing I feel I got wrong was sacrificing communicativeness for thoroughness. While I am proud of my Use Case Diagram's completeness, it could've been made more readable. After all, having a thorough model isn't helpful if reading it is difficult.

## How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
In user-facing systems, we need to make it easy for the user to use the system. If the users can't use the system, then the system fails as a system. In my system design, user use cases were conceived as all the possible ways users would access our site for. In the Activity Sequence, I detailed every step of registering for an account from finding our web service to finishing payment.

## How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
